# Personal Project About Me Page

This is a personal project inspired by a project I did in the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning

## Plan on improving the project

- Flat BEM file structure
- CSS animation and transform
- gradients
- more pages (resume, skillset, recent projects, credits etc.)
- nav menu
- page with a unique animation that looks like a retro game
- deploy a a site on github
